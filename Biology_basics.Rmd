## Outline

- Cells and genomes
- DNA, RNA, proteins
- Central dogma of molecular biology

## Cells and genomes

- A T-cell

## DNA

<img src="http://news.brown.edu/files/article_images/Senescence1.jpg" width=400>

- DNA (deoxyribose nucleic acid) contains the genetic instructions (A, G, C,T).

- Double stranded (complementary)
G-C, A-T


## RNA

(Source: Wikipedia)

- RNA (Ribonucleic acid) ressembles DNA
- Single stranded, much shorter than DNA
- Four bases A, C, G and U.

## Protein

(Source: Wikipedia)

- Organic compounds (amino acids joined by peptide bonds)
- ￼Essential to the structure and function of all living cells and viruses
- 20 possible amino acids (Lysine, Leucine, etc.)
- Folding → Function

## DNA, RNA and Proteins (and more)

- How do they interact?
- How do we get from DNA to proteins?


## The Central Dogma

- Certain pieces (genes) are transcribed
- Gene &#8776; piece of DNA coding for a protein
- Gene &#8594; Protein (Gene is expressed)

## Summary

- DNA &#8594; RNA &#8594; Proteins
- Can measure proteins directly but measuring
- mRNA levels is easier
- mRNA levels (gene expression levels) tell us something about proteins
- How do we measure gene expression levels? Microarrays → Gene expression and more!
- **Understanding gene regulation requires a lot more than just gene expression**: Chromatin, miRNA, alternative splicing, methylation, etc.

## A myriad of high-throughput technologies

- We have already been through multiple technical revolutions, e.g.

    - Microarrays
    - Next generation sequencing
    - Single-cell sequencing
    
- These technologies generate large and multidimensional data!
- In general large $p$, small $n$, mostly due to cost
- Significant statistical challenges
